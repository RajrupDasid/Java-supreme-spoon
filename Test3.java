/* This is a multi-line comment 
here in this Test3 file we have taken a public class, which name has to be the same as the file name according to the documentation.

The meaning of public static void main is:
main - which is a method, the entry point of a Java program.
public - means the main method can be accessed from outside the class.
static - indicates that the method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object of the class.
void - means the main method does not return any value.
main(String[] args) - takes a String array as a parameter named "args", which is used to pass command-line arguments to the program.
